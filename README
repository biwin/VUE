VUE modified to suit my (Apollia's) personal tastes.

Warning: This might be glitchy.  I'm still mostly a Java newbie.

Changelog
---------

Jan. 7, 2017:  Here's what I managed to do so far:

* Turned on debug mode.


* Made it so when running VUE on a Unix-like platform, the default Java look-and-feel is now GTK, not Metal.  (This is just to make VUE blend in better with my preferred dark GTK theme.)


* Switching to the GTK look-and-feel somehow made it impossible to get out of (or into) split-screen mode.  So, I got rid of the split-screen that appears at startup.  (Told the mViewerSplit object to remove its righthand panel.)


* Made it possible to successfully open files and web pages by clicking resource buttons attached to nodes (or as I prefer to call them, bubbles).

Now, VUE doesn't try to open GNOME, KDE, Firefox, or Netscape to deal with filepath resources or URL resources attached to bubbles.

Instead, VUE tries to send filepaths to a shell command called "for_vue---filepath_opener", and tries to send URLs to a shell command called "for_vue---weburl_opener".

Those shell commands can do anything you want.  On my system, "for_vue---filepath_opener" is simply a symlink to Puppy Linux's default file-manager, Rox-Filer, and "for_vue---weburl_opener" is a symlink to the Pale Moon web browser.

So, now I can do things like launch other programs and scripts, and visit web pages, just by clicking currently inconveniently tiny buttons in VUE.

Reminds me a little of HyperCard.  http://www.loper-os.org/?p=568


* Changed the default background color for new maps to black.


* Removed the border from the "Search Everything" box (which apparently doesn't do anything, at least in Puppy Linux) and changed it to green text on a darker green background.


----

Jan. 23, 2017:

* A new submenu of the Edit menu called "Etc."  I moved the dangerous "Cut" and "Delete" menu items into it.


* A new command, "Insert Current Date/Time" (keyboard shortcut: F5).  It's in the new "Insert Bubble or Text" submenu of the Edit menu.

It inserts dates in this format: 2017-01-23 14:55:49

It works on bubbles or links, but for some reason, doesn't work on text blocks.  (Which I didn't fix, because I never use text blocks anyway.)

If no bubble or link is selected, or if more than one is selected, a new bubble is created, containing the current date/time.

If one bubble or link is selected, the current date/time is added to the label of the selected bubble or link, either at the end of the label, or wherever the caret currently is.


* Changed the original dangerous behavior of ESC while editing a bubble label or link label.

Originally, ESC would delete all the changes to a bubble label or link label, and even Undo or Redo couldn't retrieve whatever was deleted.

Now, ESC leaves the label text alone, and just deselects the bubble or link you were editing.

(Which is how text blocks already reacted to ESC, so I didn't change anything related to text blocks.)


* Now, bubbles dragged into other bubbles won't be shrunk down and won't have their background colors darkened.

And images dragged into bubbles also won't be shrunk down.

Feb. 10, 2017:

* Formerly, clicking a bubble to edit it would unnecessarily highlight all text.  Now, VUE automatically unhighlights that text, so fewer clicks are necessary to edit a bubble.

* A new Edit menu item - Deselect. (Keyboard shortcut: ESC)  Only works if only one item is selected.

* All text in both bubbles and links is now left-justified.

* Formerly, the text caret couldn't be seen on dark backgrounds.  To fix that, the text caret is given the same color as the current bubble or link's text color.

* I attempted to make word wrap work inside bubbles.  I got surprisingly far with it, but, unfortunately, word-wrapping went away when I loaded a saved map.  And also when changing the text color.  So, I reverted those changes, since wordwrap won't be very useful until I figure out how to fix all that.

Feb. 12, 2017:

* Now you can quickly scroll through your map tabs using your mouse wheel!

Uses almost unchanged code from here:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38463047/use-mouse-to-scroll-through-tabs-in-jtabbedpane


* It's now possible to drag and drop tabs to reorder them!

Uses code from here:

http://stackoverflow.com/a/61982

Which is unchanged except for replacing the convertTab method with an unchanged copy of the code from this post:
http://stackoverflow.com/a/8610017

Both of those links go to:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/60269/how-to-implement-draggable-tab-using-java-swing


* Possibly fixed the longstanding problem of mistaken-seeming "Failed to load map" dialog boxes sometimes popping up when loading a map (which always seemed mistaken because it always looked like the map loaded just fine).  All I had to do was comment out two lines in MapTabbedPane.java.


----

Feb. 16, 2017:

* I commented out the code that caused VUE at startup to connect to vue.tufts.edu to look for an updated version of itself.

* I commented out and/or modified the worrying-looking code that seemed to be causing VUE to send every web URL the user added to a VUE map to the website open.thumbshots.org.


* I was dismayed to find that my copy of Java seemed to be, by default, granting all permissions to any Java software I ran.

So, I tried to make a Java security policy file for VUE, to try to stop Java from being so darn permissive.  I also made some shell scripts to launch VUE using that policy file.

That policy file requires the Pro-Grade library - http://pro-grade.sourceforge.net/ - because astonishingly, without that, Java policies only have a command to "grant" permissions, but not "deny" them!

Unfortunately, I still haven't figured out how to block absolutely everything I might possibly want to block, since whether or not I use Pro-Grade, my policy file still fails to block some worrying-looking things.

Feb. 18, 2017:

* Now Ctrl-T makes a new tab with a new map, instead of inserting a new textblock.  (Ctrl-Shift-N no longer creates a new map.)

* Added a line (and comments) to the Java security policy.  That line seems to make it possible for images to get redrawn.  Otherwise, they vanish after a while, even though they appear when you first load a map.

----

Feb. 19, 2017:

* Now my VUE launcher scripts can accept arguments, so you can open the maps
of your choice at startup.

----

Feb. 21, 2017:

* Now it's possible to rename layers while using VUE in Puppy Linux.

* Now, URLs you dragdrop into a VUE map are left alone and inserted verbatim.  Newlines aren't inserted into them anymore, and they no longer get abbreviated at all.

Visual Understanding Environment (VUE) is a powerful teaching and presentation tool.

1. Code Organization
The code is organized in following folders
 src -  the source files
 test - automatic junit tests
 lib - third party libraries used in VUE
 linux - code specific to linux operating system

2. Compiling and Running
The easiest method to compile and run VUE code is using ant version 1.6 or higher. 
"build.xml" file in src folder contains many tasks to make clean builds of complete
VUE application on Linux, Mac and Windows platforms. Here is a list of few useful tasks

default - runs VUE (need to run compile task for this to work)
clean - deletes all classes compiled earlier
compile - compiles the code
jar - creates VUE.jar which contains all the required classes and libraries to run VUE

3. Contact Information
For further information on VUE visit http://vue.tufts.edu/
